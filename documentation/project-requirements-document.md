# Project Requirements Document

## Project Overview
DocuGen is an AI-powered application designed to automatically generate comprehensive project documentation for software development projects. The application allows users to specify project details and automatically creates standardized documentation tailored to their specific technology stack and requirements.

## Core Objectives
1. Streamline the documentation process for software development projects
2. Reduce time spent on creating technical documentation
3. Ensure consistency across project documents
4. Leverage AI to generate high-quality, detailed documentation
5. Support a default tech stack with customization options

## Target Users
- Software developers
- Project managers
- Development teams
- Technical product owners
- Freelance developers

## Key Features

- Team/organization plans

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Document generation should complete within 30 seconds
- The application should support concurrent users generating documentation
- API response times should be under 500ms for non-generation operations

### Security
- All user data must be encrypted at rest and in transit
- Authentication via Clerk with MFA support
- Role-based access control for team projects
- API rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Scalability
- The application should handle growing user base with minimal performance degradation
- Support for large-scale document generation

### Reliability
- 99.9% uptime for the application
- Automated backups of user data and generated documents
- Fallback mechanisms for AI service disruptions

### Compliance
- GDPR compliance for EU users
- Data retention policies
- Terms of service and privacy policy

## Integration Requirements
- OpenAI API integration for document generation
- Clerk Auth for user authentication
- Supabase for database and backend services
- Stripe for payment processing
- Optional GitHub/GitLab integration for repository structure analysis

## Deployment Requirements
- Docker containerization
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Monitoring and alerting system
- Environment configuration for development, staging, and production

## Success Criteria
- Average of 8+ hours saved per project documentation
- 4M+ tokens saved per project compared to manual documentation
- 85%+ reduction in AI hallucinations in technical documentation
- Positive user feedback and high retention rate

## Constraints
- Budget limitations for AI API usage
- Timeline constraints for MVP development
- Technical limitations of current AI capabilities
